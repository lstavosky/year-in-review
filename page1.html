					 Over the course of the school year I have done so many fun and cool things. I think the most fun I had this school year is the week I got to spend with my grandmother. The reason I got to spend time with her is that the rest of my family was on break because it was ski week. This meant I needed someone to stay with me. So I asked if my grandmother could come and visit. We hardly get to see her since she lives very far away. Our week together was really fun because just having her around makes the mood feel a little more lively. The week we were together was really fun. I wished it did not have to end.
