      Over the course of the school year I have done so many fun and cool things. I think the most fun I had this scholl is the week I got to spend with my grandmother. The reason I got to spend time with here is that the rest of my family was on break because it was ski week. This meant I needed someone to stay with me. So I asked if my grandmother could come and visit. We hardly get so see her since she very far away. She lives on the eastern seaboard while we live on the west coast. The week we were together was really fun.
