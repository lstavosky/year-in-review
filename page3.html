					 One important hobby I like to do is to cook. Cooking makes me feel happier and just helps me feel better. I especially like to cook for the people around me. Cooking for the people I love helps me gain the experience of having someone to give feedback. Another important aspect is that I like to cook with others. I really like to help my mom bake things. This is because when I was younger she would ask me and my brother to help her out. Doing this really helps me become closer to her.
